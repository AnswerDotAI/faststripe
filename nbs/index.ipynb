    "FastStripe offers several advantages over the official Stripe Python SDK:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **üîç Self-documenting**: See all available parameters with descriptions in your IDE\n",
    "- **üéØ Simplified workflows**: High-level methods for common payment patterns\n",
    "- **üì¶ Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies (just `httpx` and `fastcore`)\n",
    "- **üèóÔ∏è Consistent API**: Uniform `create`/`fetch` naming across all resources\n",
    "- **üí´ AttrDict responses**: Access response data with dot notation (`customer.email`)\n",
    "- **üîß Automatic data handling**: Nested dictionaries flattened for Stripe's API format"
