# faststripe

FastStripe is a lightweight Python library that dynamically generates Stripe API methods from the OpenAPI specification. It provides a clean, Pythonic interface to Stripe's payment processing APIs while automatically staying up-to-date with the latest API changes.

Here are some tips on using FastStripe:

- **Simple initialization**: Create a `StripeApi` instance with your API key: `api = StripeApi(api_key="sk_...")`
- **Organized endpoints**: Access endpoints by resource type (e.g., `api.customers.create()`, `api.products.fetch()`, `api.checkout_sessions.create()`)
- **Automatic parameter flattening**: Pass nested dictionaries directly - FastStripe automatically flattens them to Stripe's expected format
- **AttrDict responses**: All API responses are converted to AttrDict objects for convenient dot notation access (e.g., `customer.id`, `payment.status`)
- **High-level convenience methods**: Use simplified methods like `api.one_time_payment()` and `api.subscription()` for common workflows
- **Dynamic API updates**: The library fetches Stripe's latest OpenAPI spec at runtime, ensuring compatibility with new features
- **Consistent method naming**: POST operations become `create()`, GET operations become `fetch()` for predictable method names
- **Bearer authentication**: API key is automatically included in request headers
- **Form-encoded requests**: All data is properly formatted for Stripe's form-encoding requirements
- **Type hints**: Generated type stubs provide IDE support and better development experience
- **Development workflow**: Use `faststripe_update` command to regenerate endpoints from latest Stripe API spec
